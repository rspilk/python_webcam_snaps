Dependencies: 

VideoCapture library : http://videocapture.sourceforge.net/

PIL

Probably more things.

To use:

Install the above, adjust paths in the files to match your configuration/where you want to save pictures.

For windows, use Task Scheduler to fire the snap.vbs every time you login/unlock machine.

Then forget it is running and check back in a year for lulz.
